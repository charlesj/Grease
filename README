Grease is a simple mp3 player.  You give it a directory, it recursively searches for music files, and then plays any that it finds in a random order.

It uses ReactiveUI for MVVM, NAudio for the audio playback, Ninject for dependency injection, and taglib# for music file metadata.

Currently, I'm working on persisting volume changes, caching music file information to reduce load times, and polishing keyboard shortcuts.
